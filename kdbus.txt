communication
	- what we care about

	shared memory
		sysv shared memory
		POSIX shared mem
		memory mapping
			anonymous mappings
			mapped files
	data transfer
		byte stream
			pipe
			FIFO
			stream socket
		pseudo terminal
		message
			SYSV message queue
			POSIX message queue
			datagram socket

Android brought in:
	ashmem
		like POSIX shared memory, but "simpler" userspace api
		can discard shared memory segments under pressure
		uses virtual memory
	pmem
		shares memory between kernel and userspace
		uses physically continous memory
		for GPUs
	binder




QNX
	message passing
		tight coupling to the microkernel
		send message to other process and send control there as well
		SIMPL on Linux



	- System V IPC
	- POSIX Message Queues
